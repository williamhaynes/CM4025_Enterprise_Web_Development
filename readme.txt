####### Description #######

The app is an Angularjs implementation of a MMORPG called Guildmaster. The aim of the game is to compete against other players to climb to the top of the leaderboard and become the top ranked player by having the top ranked heroes. This is done by upgrading your heroes on the Guild page. Heroes can be sent on Adventures from the Battle map to earn your guild more gold to allow you to buy more upgrades. You can chat against your competitors and use this system to coordinate buying and selling heroes to one another.

####### Additional Comments on Functionality #######
Extensive use was made of Angularjs features to pass information to relevant part of the API via the controllers and services.

####### Future Development #######
OAuth                                           -   The code to implement OAuth was included but commented out in the final impmentation Due to Facebooks recent situation, their app support requires linking to your hosted privacy policy which was not possible. If this was hosted on an external rather than local site I would have included Facebook OAuth.
More MMORPG Elements                            -   It would be nice to have group based adventures, "Raids" or "Dungeons". The idea would be that map hexs would have a number of slots which needed to be filled, say 12 slots. Once this was met the potential for Reward would be much higher. Flavour text would also have branching interactive choices where each player would have to make individual choices to affect the whole group.
                                                -   More resources than just Gold. It would be nice to implement a more base building element to the game. This would allow the inclusion of a resource trading market to buy and sell resources. This would be a dynamic marketplace which would adjust according to supply and demand.
                                                -   In App Purchasing. Ultimately any true game has to fund itself. With resources added it would be possible to add a real money marketplace where you could buy in game resources with actual money. Limited Time and special heroes could also be added.
More User Friendly CMS                          -   User and other Content Management is handled through Robo, a MongoDB GUI tool, it would be nice to develop a web based tool for this management.

####### Conclusions #######
This project has greatly developed my understanding of angularjs with what I would argue is a strong implementation in the format. Overall I'm very happy with my MMORPG.
